# rex

Still a work in progress, not all features are implemented yet.


## What is wrong with regexes?

Regular expressions are used in a lot of places where they are clearly not the
best tool for the job. For example take syntax highlighting, where we should
use parsers instead. If you take a look at some source code written in a
language with built in support for regular expressions (Perl, Ruby, etc.)
you'll likely find other atrocious uses.

The problem is that regular expressions make it very easy to write expressions
that generate a lot of code and are slow (see theoretical background info).

This approach makes really hard to write inefficient expressions. Execution
time and memory usage of a rex is roughly proportional to the length of the
expression.

Is this approach better? I don't know, decide for yourself if you like it.

### Theoretical Background

From a mathematical standpoint the problems with regular expressions are the
following:

Regular expressions are easily translated into non-deterministic finite
automata (NFA), while a computer can only execute deterministic finite state
machines (DFA). The two are mathematically equivalent and can be converted into
one another, but at a price: To convert an NFA into a DFA the number of states
in the DFA will be O(2^(n)) in the worst case. This makes execution times
unpredictable for the person writing the expression. So conversion from a NFA
to a DFA is hard and expensive.

The other way around is similar: if we have an arbitrary DFA and we want to get
a regular expression from it, conversion is also hard and the length of the
regular expression is O(2^(n)) in the worst case (where n is the number of
states in the DFA). This time you probably get a fast regex but it's really
hard to write it.

And there are extensions to regular expressions that are implemented by some
engines that take them into the area of context-sensitive languages which makes
execution times even worse.

If you try to specify anything other than what directly generates a DFA, it
will complain and fail.

## Installation

1. Install [Racket](https://racket-lang.org)
1. Install the beautiful-racket packet using raco
```
raco pkg install beautiful-racket
```
1. Clone this repository.


## Usage

Create a file that has `#lang reader "reader.rkt"` as the first line. For it to
work the file has to be in the same directory as the code.

The initial line is followed by the actual expression. Lets take a look at what
you can do.

A file is executed by running:
```
racket filename.rkt "String to match"
```

### Syntax

The expression is composed of two parts separated by a colon ":". The first
part looks like a regular expression without any of the fancy features. Right
now there are the following wildcards: "\*" and ".". Otherwise only characters
and character ranges are allowed.

The second part explicitly defines the remaining transitions in the following
format:
```
no_one_recognized 1->one_recognized 0->no_one_recognized, = one_recognized .-> one_recognized
```
This expression matches any string that contains a "1". The equal sign denotes
an accepting state (if no equal sign is given, the last state will
automatically be the accepting state).

Whitespace is ignored by default, comments start with ; and last to the end of
the line.

### Examples

This expression matches any string starting with banana:
```
#lang reader "reader.rkt"
banana*
```

This expression is equivalent to the regex ana[na]+s*:
```
#lang reader "reader.rkt"
ananas*:0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 n->4
```
By default the states are named 0 through n. You can override the names in the
second part.

Or you can only construct an expression using only the second part:
```
#lang reader "reader.rkt"
:=even .->odd, odd .-> even
```
This recognizes strings of even length.

### Caveats

The \* and . was added to provide short usefulness expressions, but as opposed.
They don't work as you would expect. The . does what you would expect but it
has to be the only transition going out of the state, otherwise it will
complain about a non-deterministic expression.

The problem of the \* is more subtle. It controls the fail-state. Instead of
failing, the expression simply goes to the last \*. This seems reasonable but
is not the same behavior as a normal wildcard. For instance `*banana*` will not
match "bbanana"! The problem is that wildcard are inherently non-deterministic
and this is the only way I see to include support for them.

I am not sure whether it is a good idea or not to make the default behavior
match single character loops (like in bbbbanana) but not multiple character
loops (like in anananas with `*ananas`). Right now, I'm leaning towards not
**really** surprising the user vs making the default case easy.


## Future

Here is what is planned for the future. In no particular order:
* Cycles
* Branches
* Racket package for installation with raco

In the long term if this turns out to be useful, probably a fast implementation
in C or C++ is desirable.
